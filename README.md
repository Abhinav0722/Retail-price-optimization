# 🛍️ Retail Price Optimization using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that helps e-commerce retailers determine the optimal price for their products by analyzing historical sales and pricing data. The goal is to **maximize profitability while maintaining customer satisfaction**, leveraging data-driven strategies rather than guesswork.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

In a competitive retail landscape, setting the right price is critical — pricing too high drives customers away, while pricing too low reduces profit margins. This project focuses on using real-world sales data to:
- Forecast product demand
- Analyze price sensitivity
- Recommend optimal pricing strategies

---

## 🚀 Key Features & Objectives

✅ Perform comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
✅ Visualize demand-price relationships  
✅ Handle outliers and data preprocessing  
✅ Forecast demand using regression models  
✅ Optimize price based on predictive insights  
✅ Compare multiple ML algorithms for performance
